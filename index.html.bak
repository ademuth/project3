  <h2>A Brief Biography</h2>
  <p>I was born January 7th, 2002 in Chicago, IL. I have lived in Chicago ever since. I went to Bell School for middle school, Lane Tech for high school, and I am now attending Illinois Institute of Technology for college. I am majoring in Applied Cyber Security and Information Technology. I am also a member of the Delta Tau Delta Fraternity. I joined in the Spring of 2021. I am currently employed as an IT Intern at Smokeball. I have worked there since June of 2021. I really enjoy the people and sense of community at Smokeball. It is shocking how nice everyone is and how calm and relaxed everything feels there. My co-workers with more stressful jobs there may not totally agree, but I really do like working there. I am glad that my co-workers can see past my position and age and really treat me as an equal despite me being just an intern. It feels great to have that kind of respect.</p>
