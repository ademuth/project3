      <h2>The Sopranos</h2>

      <p>I love the Sopranos to death. It is my favorite show of all time. I really love how fleshed out every character is. No one is one dimensional or without their own personal life. These characters really feel like they contiue to exist when they are off screen. Also love the juxtaposition of everyday problems and problems only mobsters can relate to. For example, Tony Soprano has to deal with problems with his son driving his car without permission as well as intimidating people into giving him money. This is also while Tony has to attend therapy to address his recurring panic attacks. The prequel, The Many Saints of Newark, came out not too long ago, but I did not really like it. The characters lacked the complexity that made them so interesting on the show. Very much just felt like "hey, remember The Sopranos?". This is not how I want to remember it.</p>

    <h2>Stop Making Sense</h2>

      <p>I love this album/movie. It is a live performance by The Talking Heads. It is so energetic, fun, and weird. Nearly every song on here is better than their studio version counter-parts. There is a life and authenticity present in these live versions that the studio versions can't match.</p>

	<h2>Fallout: New Vegas</h2>
	  <img src="images/fnv.jpg" alt="Securitrons getting domed">
	  <p>Fallout: New Vegas is my favorite piece of media period. No other book or show or movie or song has moved me and changed the way I see the world like New Vegas has. Everything you do has an effect on the whole world, and there are many dilemmas that don't really seem to have a "right" answer. I love how fleshed out and interesting the world is. Its a charming satire of blind patriotism and capitalism with so many different possible interpretations. A fascist and a communist could play through the whole game and at the end believe that the game is advocating for their ideology, and neither of them would be wrong. It has been my favorite game since I was 13 and it will probably stay that way for a very long time.</p>
